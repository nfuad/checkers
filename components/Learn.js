        Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12
        colored discs (minimum). One set is dark, and the other is light. Each
        player places his/her pieces on the dark squares closest to him/her.
        Players then alternate moves.

        A typical game board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 dark
        and 32 light squares. But the numbers depend on the dimensions of the
        boardðŸ˜€ It is positioned so that each player has a light square on the
        right side corner closest to him or her.
        <br />A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. In
        most cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been
        captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are blocked in.
